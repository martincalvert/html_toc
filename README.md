html_toc
========

Table of contents creator for HTML files.

This is a Ruby based tool that will take PHP, HTM, & HTML files and search these files for HTML comments and then insert a table of contents on at the top of each file.

Currently this only detects comments that open and close on the same line.

```
ruby init.rb ~/path_to_html_files/

or 

ruby init.rb ~/path_to_html_file/

```
